# SQL-Helper
### Annotation
This project was written in order to simplify the work of technical support specialists, which I was until a certain time. My colleagues who continue to work in this field are also satisfied with this project, as it **simplifies** working with a large amount of data.
## In-Helper
Helps you **convert data**, such as the id of the entity that was sent to you as a column, to wrap each entity in brackets that your GUI requires.
## GetValue
Helps **to get** the value of the **desired key** in all JSON objects.
